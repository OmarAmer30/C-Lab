Write a C++ program for an eClinic.
The program asks the patient to enter his/her gender and whether he/she has COVID-19 in the last 3 weeks.
The gender is either 0 for males and 1 for females.
The program reads the data (gender and COVID-19 test) for 20 patients and after it reads all data,
it displays the count of females COVID-19 patients.
